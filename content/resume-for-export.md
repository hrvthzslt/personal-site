## About

I have been interested in coding since my young age and began learning web development later on.
I have since transitioned into a professional career in backend development,
starting as a junior full-stack developer and gaining experience with a range of technologies and
programming languages. I am currently a backend developer with a focus on building robust and scalable applications.
I am constantly seeking to learn and improve my skills, and I am drawn to work environments where I can collaborate
and learn from others. I am motivated by the opportunity to work towards well-defined goals and make meaningful
contributions to the team.
