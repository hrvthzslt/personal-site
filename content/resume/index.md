## About

With a genuine love for computers, I have been interested in coding since a young age and later began learning web development.

This love eventually led to a professional career in backend development, starting as a junior full-stack developer and expanding my experience with a wide range of technologies and programming languages. Over time, I have worked on projects ranging from maintaining and improving legacy monoliths to building brand new applications from the ground up. I am currently focused on backend development, creating robust and scalable systems, which are usually under severe stress.

I am always seeking opportunities to improve my skills and thrive in environments where I can collaborate and learn from others. I occasionally enjoy sharing knowledge through presentations and workshops, and I am motivated by the chance to work towards well-defined goals and make meaningful contributions that have real impact.
