I made a simple introduction to **Ansible**. It has one goal: present the **point** of using **Ansible**, in a **pre-configured environment**, without any setup.

<!--more-->

You only need **Docker** (docker compose) a **terminal emulator** and a **text editor**, to do it.

Every instruction and explanation is in the repository `README.md`. Have fun!
