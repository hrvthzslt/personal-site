One day I felt the need for look up some old book, that I used for learning my first programming language. I started my
search on [bookline.hu](https://bookline.hu/) which is a Hungarian online book store where you can buy from multiple
antiquarian book stores in one order.\
One thing led to the other and I ended up buying 5 books which I will talk about in this post. I have to clear something
up, these books are old and I bought them for the sake of nostalgia, not for the content. They are in hungarian and
the translation of the technical terms can be funky as hell.

## Pascal

I started to learn programming in the 2000s, I learned C# and Java, but my first language was Pascal. I used it for
2 year in computer science faculty once every two week. I built a graphical calculator with it, it took me about two
months because at the time I only programmed in the school, it's hard to understand why with my current mindset but
playing punk music was a much higher priority at that time of my life.

### György Pongor: Standardized Pascal: Programming and algorithms - 1993

![György Pongor - Standardized Pascal: Programming and algorithms - 1993](standardized-pascal.jpeg)

If you paid attention you might have noticed that I learned from a ten-year-old book, I did not realize that but in
a public school keeping up to date was not a focus, I'm personally still grateful that there was any opportunity to
learn about programming.\
The book itself has a quite annoying side which is a problem with most of the books I bought, the translation of terms
makes harder to understand the presented concepts, and in the code examples there are a lot of Hungarian variable and
method names. I happen to know that this is not a problem for a lot of people, but it always confused me.\
Fun fact: *the hungarian translation of Robert C. Martins Clean Code had an online dictionary because a lot of people
could not understand the translated terms, I deeply empathize.*
But there are some good things in this book! A lot of algorithm with code examples, sequence diagrams and other form
of visualization and the explanations are really thorough.\
For example **recursion** is explained with
the [Tower of Hanoi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/) algorithm with a lot of explanation
and images. This took me back.

### Erzsébet Angster: The basics of object-oriented design and programming - 1997

![Erzsébet Angster - The basics of object-oriented design and programming - 1997](the-basics-of-oop.jpeg)

I could have buy any book by Erzsébet Angster because they were a very common residents of school libraries. I choose
this one for its topic, you can find everything in it from real life examples for objects (like a butcher's shop) to
deep class inheritance hierarchy.\
This book could start a civil war in the current developer landscape, it's a product of its time. And it has pictures!

## Web development

### Julie C. Meloni: PHP, MySQL and Apache - 2004

![Julie C. Meloni: PHP, MySQL and Apache - 2004](php-mysql-apache.jpeg)

The hungarian translations of "Teach Yourself..." books were very popular in the 2000s. I'm really confused
by the editions because there are two
authors, [Julie C. Meloni](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Julie-C.-Meloni/author/B001IOF7KU?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true)
and [Matt Zandstra](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Matt-Zandstra/author/B001ITYM3S?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true)
who wrote php related books in the so-called "Sams Teach Yourself *SUBJECT* in 24 hours" series.\
This book promises a lot of things and surprisingly it sort of delivers.\
It goes through setting up a web server with Apache, MySQL and PHP on Linux and Windows (wild!). It covers the basics of
php and mysql in great detail. It has some example projects such as an online mailing list and a simple webshop with
the whole code base and every step that you need to do to get it up and running.\
This is certainly not the way that you would want to do any development nowadays. The codebase is composed of php files
which includes html and php blocks in a sequential manner representing one page, long time ago I did maintain sites with
this structure, and it does not scale... I mean at all. On the other hand the database schemas are well normalized and
the configuration of Apache is nicely explained.\
This is not how you develop a project, but it makes you understand the important parts of the stack.

## Bonus

### András Büki: UNIX/Linux shell programming - 2002

![András Büki: UNIX/Linux shell programming - 2002](shell-programming.jpeg)

This is the bonus book, I did not read it when it came out. I bought it because the title of this book is the
one to one translation of "Shell programming" and I found it hilarious.\
All that said, I really like this one because of its subject, It's a good introduction to shell scripting. It has code
examples, a lot of commands with explanation, a lot of tasks to solve with solutions and bad terminology hungarian
translations (for example *pipeline* is more like *"pipe network"* in the translation).\
I love it!\
Although I didn't check but I'm not sure that the shebang `#!/bin/sh` is correct for every code example, but I will
let the POSIX compliance police to deal with that.

### Microsoft MS-DOS Version 5.0 Manual - 1991

![Microsoft MS-DOS Version 5.0 Manual - 1991](ms-dos-manual.jpeg)

This must seem quite random, but I bought this because this was the first command line I used.\
My first computer was an Amiga 500 and me and my parents thought that it was simply for playing games. You see, if you
put a floppy disk with a game in it to the floppy drive, the computer will start the game.\
So with ignorance and with some good intentions my parents asked me if I would want a computer for other purposes
as well. I said yes, they changed my Amiga 500 to a PC with a 80386 processor. And there I met mr. MS-DOS.

## Conclusion

I'm not gonna say that I recommend these books, but I do recommend to show some appreciation for your old books and see
how far you come.
