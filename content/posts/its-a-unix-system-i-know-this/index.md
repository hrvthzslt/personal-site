Recently, I had the pleasure of giving a presentation about UNIX-like operating systems. Many of us use **Linux** or **macOS**, so I tried to collect the most important foundational concepts. At the same time, I incorporated new knowledge as it came up during the presentation to make the structure more interesting.

In the end, I wouldn't say that I'm fully satisfied with the arrangement of the presentation, but I would like to share it nonetheless.

Please check it out [here](https://github.com/hrvthzslt/its-a-unix-system) if you're interested. The presentation can be played with **slides**, and you can try everything out in a dedicated **container** that is mentioned.
