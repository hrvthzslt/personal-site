I was an Obsidian user for some time and I still really like it, but it was too much for my needs.
There is only two function I need:

- Creating a note to a destination
- Searching in notes

And to this with markdown files, because there is nothing better on Earth if you are not a print editor.

## Markdown

At primary school we was hard into editing Word documents, and the main dogma of this process was the following: Children, first type the raw text than format it!\
This causes two problems, the context of the text is only changeable in the dedicated editor. This not scale at all, changing the formatted text with raw text and formatting it again is just a nuance.

The reason I love markdown is that the text and its context in one place, and rendering it is decoupled from the file itself. You can render it as **html**, convert it into **pdf**, or just use a viewer/editor you like, but the most important you can edit it with any editor that can open a text file.\
I kept the most important reason last: **It is dead simple** (like me).

## Note management

So I technically can provide myself the two functionalities with gnu tools in the cli like a *komputer scientist*, and I did that but this needed to be more convenient, So I made a hundred line **shell script** solving this "problem".
